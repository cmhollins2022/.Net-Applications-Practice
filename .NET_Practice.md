# Introduction

### What is .NET?

**.NET is an ecosystem for application development**

- The term ecosystem describes the multiple facets of an application development environment and the community that surrounds it. 
- These facets combine to create a compelling reason to invest in learning .NET and building .NET applications.
- 

**Use .NET languages and compilers to run applications in the .NET runtime**
- Software developers use .NET languages like C# and F# to write source code. Each line of code they write expresses an instruction or command the computer should perform while the program is running.
- Before software developers can run their code, they must first compile it. The .NET compiler is a program that converts the source code into a special language called intermediate language (IL).
- The .NET runtime is an execution environment for your compiled .NET assembly. In other words, the .NET runtime is what executes and manages your application as it runs on a host operating system.

**Use .NET application frameworks and libraries to harness prebuilt functionality**

All software is built in layers, meaning software runs at various levels of abstraction on a computer:

- At the lowest level, software communicates directly with your computer's hardware. It controls the flow of data on the motherboard, processors, memory, and hard drives.
- At the next level, software allows the end user to provide instructions through an operating system.
- At the next level, software like .NET provides a way for you to develop and run applications.
- At the next level, application frameworks and libraries of functionality allow you to quickly build rich applications by using less effort than older development methods allowed.

**Use .NET tools to build .NET apps**

_Visual Studio 2022_ is the Microsoft flagship development environment. Millions of developers use it to build .NET applications. 
- A graphical user interface (that includes menus, windows, visual designers, dialog boxes, and wizards) guides developers through the application development process. Visual Studio 2022 is available in three editions: Community, Professional, and Enterprise. Each edition includes different tools and is licensed for different purposes.
