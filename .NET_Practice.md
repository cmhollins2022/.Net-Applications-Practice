# Introduction

### What is .NET?

**.NET is an ecosystem for application development.**

- The term ecosystem describes the multiple facets of an application development environment and the community that surrounds it. 
- These facets combine to create a compelling reason to invest in learning .NET and building .NET applications.
- 

**Use .NET languages and compilers to run applications in the .NET runtime**
- Software developers use .NET languages like C# and F# to write source code. Each line of code they write expresses an instruction or command the computer should perform while the program is running.
- Before software developers can run their code, they must first compile it. The .NET compiler is a program that converts the source code into a special language called intermediate language (IL).
- The .NET runtime is an execution environment for your compiled .NET assembly. In other words, the .NET runtime is what executes and manages your application as it runs on a host operating system.
