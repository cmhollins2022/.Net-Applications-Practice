# Introduction

### What is .NET?

**.NET is an ecosystem for application development**

- The term ecosystem describes the multiple facets of an application development environment and the community that surrounds it. 
- These facets combine to create a compelling reason to invest in learning .NET and building .NET applications.
- 

**Use .NET languages and compilers to run applications in the .NET runtime**
- Software developers use .NET languages like C# and F# to write source code. Each line of code they write expresses an instruction or command the computer should perform while the program is running.
- Before software developers can run their code, they must first compile it. The .NET compiler is a program that converts the source code into a special language called intermediate language (IL).
- The .NET runtime is an execution environment for your compiled .NET assembly. In other words, the .NET runtime is what executes and manages your application as it runs on a host operating system.

**Use .NET application frameworks and libraries to harness prebuilt functionality**

All software is built in layers, meaning software runs at various levels of abstraction on a computer:

- At the lowest level, software communicates directly with your computer's hardware. It controls the flow of data on the motherboard, processors, memory, and hard drives.
- At the next level, software allows the end user to provide instructions through an operating system.
- At the next level, software like .NET provides a way for you to develop and run applications.
- At the next level, application frameworks and libraries of functionality allow you to quickly build rich applications by using less effort than older development methods allowed.

**Use .NET tools to build .NET apps**

_Visual Studio 2022_ is the Microsoft flagship development environment. Millions of developers use it to build .NET applications. 
- A graphical user interface (that includes menus, windows, visual designers, dialog boxes, and wizards) guides developers through the application development process. Visual Studio 2022 is available in three editions: Community, Professional, and Enterprise. Each edition includes different tools and is licensed for different purposes.

```
using System;

public class Program
{
  public static void Main()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Hello world!");
  }
}
```
**What happens to your code after it's inserted into the Main() method?**

The most important part of this exercise is what happens after the code you write is inserted into a ```Main()``` method. Keep in mind that this process happens on a server on your behalf.

1. A command to compile your new code invokes the C# compiler.

2. The C# compiler ensures your code can be compiled and is free from syntax errors. If it can't compile your code, the compiler stops and sends an error message back to the **Output** pane.

3. If the C# compiler succeeds, the .NET runtime opens the newly compiled .NET assembly. By default, it looks in a class named ```Program``` to find a method named ```Main()``` to begin running the instructions.

4. Instruction by instruction, the .NET runtime evaluates each line of code. It runs the instruction and moves to the next line of code.

5. In this case, when the instruction to print the words "Hello world!" finishes, the running path continues to the next line but finds nothing. The path ends, and the .NET runtime removes the program from its memory. Meanwhile, the output from the ```WriteLine()``` instruction is delivered back to your web browser.

**.NET is for projects large and small**
- Millions of developers use .NET every day to do amazing things. 
- It gives them tools to build the kinds of applications that matter to them.

**Choose .NET when productivity matters**
- After you learn how to build an application based on one app model, you can easily apply your learning to something else, even if it uses a different app model.
- Repurposing your knowledge reduces the time and stress involved in learning a new programming model or language.
**Choose .NET for enterprise-scale applications**
- Advantages include its ecosystem and its integration with other Microsoft products, including Azure cloud services and on-premise server products.
- .NET is a strongly typed system, so it avoids many of the bugs that can arise in loosely typed systems. 
- Developers can choose to use an object-based paradigm in C#, or a functional-based paradigm in F#. They use the language that best fits the kinds of problems they need to solve.

**Choose .NET for prototypes, start-ups, and small-scale applications**
- Popular for small projects because of its long history of improvements to the design of languages, APIs, and tools based on customer feedback and telemetry.
- develop full-featured software quickly for prototyping purposes.

**Choose .NET for cloud and AI applications**
- The Azure SDK for .NET allows developers to provision and manage Azure resources. Alternatively, Azure App Service and Azure Functions can host applications built using .NET languages.

- ML.NET is a free machine learning library for .NET languages. It enables model-based capabilities for machine learning analysis and prediction.

**Choose .NET to build IoT applications**
- You can use .NET to build IoT applications for IoT devices and scenarios. IoT applications typically interact with sensors, displays, and input devices that require the use of general-purpose I/O (GPIO) pins, serial ports, or similar hardware.
- You can find libraries that work with popular boards like Raspberry Pi and HummingBoard.
